Notes:

- Coding modifications:
  - In the OG, for some reason, income is added directly from the trains, but is presented divided by 2. It's added /2 to the income array, but e.g. in the train data structure, is added directly and then divided by 2 in presentation. The station box also divides by 2 when presenting the amount earned this period, and for priority shipment, we multiply by 2 in order to cancel out the late division by 2.
  All of this is very confusing, and was probably a last minute adjustment. Instead, we just do the division by 2 early (when earning the money), and everything is simplified from that point on, aside from the number of dings when the train delivers.

- Fixes/Alterations:
  - The way the code is written, some metal bridges are just cursed. Changed it to be more fair.
  - According to the manual, there should be a small chance of stone bridges washing out, but this was not present in the code. Added to make stone bridges' advantage not so absolute.

- Enhancement Ideas:
  - Have tile development rate depend on economic climate (not present currently)
  - Bridge maintenance: when we roll a bridge spot, should be much more expensive
  - Currently all resources convert to others automatically. So a power plant converts coal to steel.
  - Also they convert to one thing only!
    Ideally:
      - Power plants shouldn't create steel
      - Each tile determines what it converts to.
      - Power plants only exist after a certain date?
      - Once they exist, they increase growth of cities/factories (large range)
  - Add more resource chains
  - Tourism sites?
