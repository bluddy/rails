Notes:

- Fixes/Alterations:
  - The way the code is written, some metal bridges are just cursed. Changed it to be more fair.
  - According to the manual, there should be a small chance of stone bridges washing out.

- Enhancement Ideas:
  - Currently all resources convert to others automatically. So a power plant converts coal to steel.
  - Also they convert to one thing only!
    Ideally:
      - Power plants shouldn't create steel
      - Each tile determines what it converts to.
      - Power plants only exist after a certain date?
      - Once they exist, they increase growth of cities/factories (large range)
  - Add resource chains
  - Tourism sites?
  - Have tile development depend on climate
