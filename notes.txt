Notes:

- Money is always added directly (at system level), but viewed /2 and saved /2
  - Print out money / 2 in train ui arrival msg
  - Feels like a last-minute adjustment they made
  - Add money / 2 to money array, also to money
  - Train view:
    - Money added directly
    - But when viewing, money / 2, money per period / 2
  - Station box:
    - div money by 2
  - Priority completion:
    - mult by 2 before div by 2 to cancel it out

- Fixes/Alterations:
  - The way the code is written, some metal bridges are just cursed. Changed it to be more fair.
  - According to the manual, there should be a small chance of stone bridges washing out. Added.

- Enhancement Ideas:
  - Have tile development rate depend on economic climate (not present currently)
  - Bridge maintenance: when we roll a bridge spot, should be much more expensive
  - Currently all resources convert to others automatically. So a power plant converts coal to steel.
  - Also they convert to one thing only!
    Ideally:
      - Power plants shouldn't create steel
      - Each tile determines what it converts to.
      - Power plants only exist after a certain date?
      - Once they exist, they increase growth of cities/factories (large range)
  - Add more resource chains
  - Tourism sites?
