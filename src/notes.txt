Notes:
- Survey view tends to freeze after a little while
- F2 view a little buggy, sometimes freezes
- Building over water not handled
- Tunnel goes very long
- Cursor movement with tunnel and bridge is flaky
- Disable building over built track - including high grade message
- Modal Menus: open and highlight first option
- Modal Menus: standardize so most behavior doesn't need special handling
