Notes:
- F2 view a little buggy, sometimes freezes
  - Due to fps issues over X. Connection collapses
  - Reduce fps
  - Standardize ticks, not same as fps
- TODO:
  - remove track
  - draw track in f2 and f3
  - Modal Menus: standardize so most behavior doesn't need special handling
  - Don't allow station on curved tracks
