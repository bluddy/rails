Notes:
- F2 view a little buggy, sometimes freezes
  - Due to fps issues over X. Connection collapses
  - Reduce fps
  - Standardize ticks, not same as fps
- Building over water needs debugging
- Modal Menus: open and highlight first option
- Modal Menus: standardize so most behavior doesn't need special handling
- Build track menu: handle cancel
