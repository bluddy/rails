Notes:
- TODO:
  - draw track in f2 and f3
  - Modal Menus: standardize so most behavior doesn't need special handling
  - Don't allow station on curved tracks
  - Fixes to grade: % shows up wrong
  - Build tunnel:
    - Tunnel msgbox incorrect
    - Not sure how it decides to end tunnel
    - Shows msgbox with cost and length of tunnel to confirm
  - Build track:
    - Always connect to track, unless no track exists
  - Next: stations and intersections


- F2 view a little buggy, sometimes freezes
  - Due to fps issues over X. Connection collapses
  - Reduce fps
  - Standardize ticks, not same as fps
