  - Undo: don't track in graph. Just add a scan function that gets train counts by station.
    - Tracking by ixn adds too many edge cases
- Make sure money gets deducted for new engine
  - Also for new train
  - Also for station, upgrade etc
- Bug:
  - First engines use one-chimney img. Check in code.
  - Where does smoke originate? Check in code.
  - Smoke seems to go in different direction from game
  - After load, trains are stuck
  - joining a track from another track either refuses or crashes
  - Circular track will cause infinite loop
