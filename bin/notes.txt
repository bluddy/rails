Notes:
- TODO:
  - Don't allow station on curved tracks
  - Build tunnel:
    - Shows msgbox with cost and length of tunnel to confirm
  - Build track:
    - Always connect to track, unless no track exists
  - TileInfo:
    - Show demand/convert (not sure when)
  - Next: stations and intersections
  - Station Screen
  - Route Screen
  - Trains
  - Money handling
  - History
  - Reports
  - Stock Screen
  - AI


- F2 view a little buggy, sometimes freezes
  - Due to fps issues over X. Connection collapses
  - Reduce fps
  - Standardize ticks, not same as fps

- Enhancements:
  - Currently all resources convert to others automatically. So a power plant converts coal to steel.
  - Also they convert to one thing only!
    Ideally:
      - Power plants shouldn't create steel
      -each tile determines what it converts to.
      - Power plants only exist after a certain date
      - Once they exist, they increase growth of cities/factories (large range)
  - Add resource chains
  - Tourism sites?
